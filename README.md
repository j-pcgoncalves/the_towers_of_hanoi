# the_towers_of_hanoi

This project was made for Codecademy. It is the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, which is an ancient mathematical puzzle. In this puzzle you start with how many disks, each smaller than the one below, which means that the bigger disk is the one on the bottom of the stack. You have 3 stacks and you start with the stack on the left. The objective of the puzzle is putting all the disks, in the same order as it started in the right stack. You can't put a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk. In this program i use stacks to store the data needed to play the game.
